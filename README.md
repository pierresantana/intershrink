## React Challenge

The challenge consists on a **landing page** capable of generating a functional, shortened *link* based on an *input* of a URL. This project will evaluate the developer' skills and code quality when transforming a *layout* in a functional prototype, along with the backend and frontend properly separated.

The URL shortener must be implemented at the *backend* together with a validator, which must be able to indicate if the generated *link* is actually working. The communication between backend and frontend must be handled by a RESTful API, where the results will be shown.

It's expected that on top of shortening a URL, we are also able to keep an access count, so each time the URL is accessed, we can track a list of these accumulated values and rank the URLs properly.

All data must be saved on a database.

### Instructions

- Using this repository, work on the challenge by creating a branch with your name (example: `name-surname`).
- A considerable part of your goal deals with transforming the [mockup](mockup.png) into a working prototype.
- On your project, create a repository called 'project'. All files that you create must be inside this folder.
- When you're done with your challenge, open a **Merge Request** with your changes.

### Requirements

- The *frontend* must be developed using the React *framework*
- The *backend* must be developed using the Node.js *framework*

### Layout

- The used font is [SF Pro Display](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)
- You can find the necessary images [here](/images)

**Colors**

- Fantasy `#f9f2f2`
- Radical Red `#f6435d`
- Chicago `#605c5c`
